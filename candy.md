# Candy
- There are N children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value.

- You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

- Each child must have at least one candy.
- Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
- What is the minimum candies you must give?

> Example 1:

> Input: [1,0,2]
> Output: 5
> Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.

> Example 2:

> Input: [1,2,2]
> Output: 4
> Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
> The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.
