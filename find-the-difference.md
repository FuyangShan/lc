# Find the difference
- Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.

- String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

- Find the letter that was added in t.

> Example:

> Input:
> s = "abcd"
> t = "abcde"

> Output:
> e

> Explanation:
> 'e' is the letter that was added.
```java

class Solution {
    public char findTheDifference(String s, String t) {
        int[] array = new int[26];
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            array[c - 'a']++;
        }
        
        for (char c : t.toCharArray()) {
            array[c - 'a']--;
            if (array[c - 'a'] < 0) return c;
        }
        
        return 'a';
    }
}
